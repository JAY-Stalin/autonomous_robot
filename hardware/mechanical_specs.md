# Mechanical Specifications

## Chassis

Type: 4-wheel differential drive (4x4)  
Drive configuration: Left wheels grouped + Right wheels grouped  

---

## Wheels

Approximate wheel diameter: 6.5 cm  

### Derived values

Radius:
3.25 cm

Circumference:
C = πD  
C ≈ 3.1416 × 6.5 cm ≈ 20.4 cm

Meaning:
- One full wheel rotation ≈ 20.4 cm travel

---

## Implications

- Distance estimation can use wheel rotations
- Speed estimation possible via RPM
- Turning radius depends on wheelbase width (TBD)

---

## Motor Specification (Estimated)

Motor type: Generic TT gear motor  
Estimated rated RPM: **200 RPM**  
Operating voltage: 3–6V  

NOTE:
Exact RPM unknown and will be measured experimentally.

---

## Estimated Maximum Speed

Wheel circumference ≈ 20.4 cm

Speed ≈ RPM × circumference

200 × 20.4 cm/min ≈ 4080 cm/min  
≈ 68 cm/s  
≈ **0.68 m/s**

This represents the theoretical maximum speed without load.
