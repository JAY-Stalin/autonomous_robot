# Mechanical Specifications

## Chassis

Type: 4-wheel differential drive (4x4)  
Drive configuration: Left wheels grouped + Right wheels grouped  

---

## Wheels

Approximate wheel diameter: 6.5 cm  

### Derived values

Radius:
3.25 cm

Circumference:
C = πD  
C ≈ 3.1416 × 6.5 cm ≈ 20.4 cm

Meaning:
- One full wheel rotation ≈ 20.4 cm travel

---

## Implications

- Distance estimation can use wheel rotations
- Speed estimation possible via RPM
- Turning radius depends on wheelbase width (TBD)
